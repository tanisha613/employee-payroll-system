Employee is the superclass and full time employee and part time employee is the subclass.
Payroll system class manages the employee class and full time and part time employee class
Payroll system helps to identify the id,name,salary of any employee
We will apply abstraction in employee class by making it an abstract class and we will make an abstract method inside the employee class.
As employee class is the abstract class so we have to inherit it from other classes,because we canâ€™t create its object directly
Part time salary of the employee depend on no. of hours and hourly rate 
      
 Concepts Used
Abstraction through use of abstract class and abstract method
Use of getName() and getId() methods to provide privacy and safety to the department  and easy access of the value to the user. (we are using encapsulation here)
Access Modifiers
Concept and use of constructor
Use of this keyword
Inheritance (use of extends keyword)
Concept of override so to use polymorphism efficiently
Use of super keyword to access parent class from child class
ArrayList
